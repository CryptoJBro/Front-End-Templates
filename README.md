# Front-End-Templates
As I learn web development, I'll add basic front end templates to this repository.  Feel free to use them!

My main goal in learning web development and coding is to work on decentralized projects.  I am fascinated by blockchain, crypto, and the new decentralized tech such as Holochain.  I am actually starting to learn Rust for Holochain development.  It's tough, but I like the challenge.
