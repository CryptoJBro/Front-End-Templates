# Front-End-Templates
As I learn web development, I will create some front end templates in this repository.  I hope you find them useful.

My main goal in learning web development and programming is to work on decentralized projects.  I am fascinated by blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
